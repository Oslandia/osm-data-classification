#+TITLE: OSM user classification: let's use machine learning!
#+AUTHOR: Damien Garaud <damien.garaud@oslandia.com>, Raphaël Delhome <raphael.delhome@oslandia.com>

# Common introduction for articles of the OSM-data-quality series
At [[http://oslandia.com/][Oslandia]], we like working with Open Source tool projects and handling Open
(geospatial) Data. In this article series, we will play with the [[https://www.openstreetmap.org/][OpenStreetMap]]
(/OSM/) map and subsequent data. Here comes the sixth article of this series,
dedicated to user classification using the power of machine learning algorithms

* Let's remind the user metadata

After the previous blog post, we got a set of features aiming to describe how
OSM users contribute to the mapping effort. That is our raw materials towards
the clustering process.

** Metadata recovery

If we saved the user metadata in a dedicated =.csv= file, it can be recovered
easily:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
import pandas as pd
user_md = pd.read_csv("../src/data/output-extracts/bordeaux-metropole/bordeaux-metropole-user-md-extra.csv", index_col=0)
user_md.query('uid==24664').T

/Hum... It seems that some unknown features have been added in this table,
isn't it?/

Well yes! We had some more variables to make the analysis finer. We propose you
to focus on the total number of change sets that each user has opened, and the
corresponding ratio between change set amount around Bordeaux and this
quantity. Then we studied the editors each user have used: JOSM? iD? Potlatch?
Maps me? Another one? Maybe this will give a useful extra-information to design
user groups.

As a total, we have 40 features that describe user behavior, and 2073 users.

** Feature normalization

*** It's normal not to be Gaussian!

We plan to reduce the number of variables, to keep the analysis readable and
interpretable; and run a k-means clustering to group similar users together.

Unfortunately we can't proceed directly to such machine learning procedures:
they need as input gaussian-distributed features. As illustrated by the
following histograms, focused on some available features, it is not the case
here; moreover the features are highly-skewed, that leading us to consider an
alternative normalization scheme.

f, ax = plt.subplots(1,3, figsize=(12,4))
ax[0].hist(user_md.n_node_modif, bins=np.linspace(0,500, 25), color='r', normed=True)
ax[0].set_xlabel('Number of node modifications')

*** Feature engineering

The basic idea we want you to keep in mind is the following one: if we find
some mathematical tricks to express our variables between simple bounds (/e.g./
0 and 100, or -1 and 1), we could have smarter way to represent the user
characteristics.

First of all you should notice that a lot of variables can be expressed as percentages of other variables:

- the number of node/way/relation modifications amongst all modifications;
- the number of created/improved/deleted elements amongst all modifications,
  for each element type;
- the number of change sets opened with a given editor, amongst all change sets.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
def normalize_features(metadata, total_column):
    transformed_columns = metadata.columns[metadata.columns.to_series()
                                           .str.contains(total_column)]
    metadata[transformed_columns[1:]] = metadata[transformed_columns].apply(lambda x: (x[1:]/x[0]).fillna(0), axis=1)

normalize_features(user_md, 'n_total_modif')
normalize_features(user_md, 'n_node_modif')
normalize_features(user_md, 'n_way_modif')
normalize_features(user_md, 'n_relation_modif')
normalize_features(user_md, 'n_total_chgset')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Other features can be normalized starting from their definition: we know that
=lifespan= and =n_inscription_days= can't be larger than the OSM lifespan
itself (we consider the OSM lifespan as the difference between the first year
of modification within the area and the extraction date).

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
timehorizon = (pd.Timestamp("2017-02-19") - pd.Timestamp("2007-01-01"))/pd.Timedelta('1d')
user_md['lifespan'] = user_md['lifespan'] / timehorizon
user_md['n_inscription_days'] = user_md['n_inscription_days'] / timehorizon
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Finally we have to consider the remainder of features that can't be normalized
as percentages of other variables, or as percentages of meaningful
quantities. How can we treat them?

We choose to transform these features by comparing users between each other:
knowing that a user did 100 modifications is interesting, however we could also
compare it with other users, /e.g./ by answering the question "how many users
did less modifications?". That's typically the definition of the empirical
cumulative distribution function.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
import statsmodels.api as sm

def ecdf_transform(metadata, feature):
    ecdf = sm.distributions.ECDF(metadata[feature])
    metadata[feature] = ecdf(metadata[feature])
    new_feature_name = 'u_' + feature.split('_', 1)[1]
    return metadata.rename(columns={feature: new_feature_name})

user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_activity_days')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_chgset')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'nmean_modif_byelem')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_total_modif')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_node_modif')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_way_modif')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_relation_modif')
user_md = ecdf_transform(user_md, 'n_total_chgset')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:

Consequently we can characterize a user with such new dashboard:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both

#+end_example

We then know that the user with ID 24664 did more node, way and relation
modifications than respectively 96.7, 97.2 and 98.5% of other users, or that
amongst his node modifications, 50.9% were creations, and so on...

In order to complete the normalization procedure, we add a final step that
consists in scaling the features, to ensure that all of them have the same
/min/ and /max/ values. As the features are still skewed, we do it according to
a simple Min-Max rule, so as to avoid too much distorsion of our data:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
from sklearn.preprocessing import RobustScaler

scaler = RobustScaler(quantile_range=(0.0,100.0)) # = Min-max scaler
X = scaler.fit_transform(user_md.values)

* Develop a Principle Component Analysis (PCA)

From now we can try to add some intelligence into the data by using well-known
machine learning tools.

Reduce the dimensionality of a problem often appears as a unavoidable
pre-requisite before undertaking any classification effort.

As developped previously, we have 40 variables. That seems quite small for
implementing a PCA (we could apply directly a clustering algorithm on our
normalized data); however for a sake of clarity regarding result
interpretation, we decide to add this step into the analysis.

** PCA design

Summarize the complete user table by just a few synthetic components is
appealing; however you certainly want to ask "how many components?"! The
principle component analysis is a linear projection of individuals on a smaller
dimension space. It provides uncorrelated components, dropping redundant
information given by subsets of initial dataset.

Actually there is no ideal component number, it can depend on modeller wishes;
however in general this quantity is chosen according to the explained variance
proportion, and/or according to eigen values of components. There are some rule
of thumbs for such a situation: we can choose to take components to cover at
least 70% of the variance, or to consider components that have an eigen value
larger than 1.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both :file ../figs/bordeaux-metropole-varmat.png
cov_mat = np.cov(X.T)
eig_vals, eig_vecs = np.linalg.eig(cov_mat)
eig_vals = sorted(eig_vals, reverse=True)
tot = sum(eig_vals)
varexp = [(i/tot)*100 for i in eig_vals]
cumvarexp = np.cumsum(varexp)
varmat = pd.DataFrame({'eig': eig_vals,
                       'varexp': varexp,
                       'cumvar': cumvarexp})[['eig','varexp','cumvar']]
f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 2, figsize=(12,6))
ax[0].bar(range(1,1+len(varmat)), varmat['varexp'].values, alpha=0.25, 
        align='center', label='individual explained variance', color = 'g')
ax[0].step(range(1,1+len(varmat)), varmat['cumvar'].values, where='mid',
         label='cumulative explained variance')
ax[0].axhline(70, color="blue", linestyle="dotted")
ax[0].legend(loc='best')
ax[1].bar(range(1,1+len(varmat)), varmat['eig'].values, alpha=0.25,
          align='center', label='eigenvalues', color='r')
ax[1].axhline(1, color="red", linestyle="dotted")
ax[1].legend(loc="best")
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../figs/bordeaux-metropole-varmat.png]]

Here the second rule of thumb fails, as we do not use a standard scaling
process (/e.g./ less mean, divided by standard deviation), however the first
one makes us consider 6 components (that explain around 72% of the total
variance). The exact figures can be checked in the =varmat= data frame:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
varmat.head(6)
#+END_SRC

: 5  0.181339   4.770501  72.490687


** PCA running

The PCA algorithm is loaded from a =sklearn= module, we just have to run it by
giving a number of components as a parameter, and to apply the =fit_transform=
procedure to get the new linear projection. Moreover the contribution of each
feature to the new components is straightforwardly accessible with the
=sklearn= API.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
model = PCA(n_components=6)
Xpca = model.fit_transform(X)
pca_cols = ['PC' + str(i+1) for i in range(6)]
pca_ind = pd.DataFrame(Xpca, columns=pca_cols, index=user_md.index)
pca_var = pd.DataFrame(model.components_, index=pca_cols,
                       columns=user_md.columns).T
pca_ind.query("uid==24664").T
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: uid     24664
: PC1 -0.358475
: PC2  1.671158
: PC3  0.121610
: PC4 -0.139444
: PC5 -0.983182
: PC6  0.409357

Oh yeah, after running the PCA, the information about the user is summarized
with these 6 cryptic values. It could be largely better to know which meaning
these 6 components have.

** Component interpretation

By taking advantage of =seaborn= capability, we can plot the feature
contributions to each components. All these contributions are comprised between
-1 (a strong negative contribution) and 1 (a strong positive
contribution). Additionnally there is a mathematical relation between all
contributions to a given component: the sum of squares equals to 1! As a
consequence we can really consider that features can be ranked by order of
importance in the component definition.

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both :file ../figs/bordeaux-metropole-feature-contrib.png
f, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12,12))

sns.set_context('paper')
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
[[file:../figs/bordeaux-metropole-feature-contrib.png]]

Here our six components may be described as follows:

+ PC1 (28.5% of total variance) is really impacted by relation modifications,
  this component will be high if user did a lot of relation improvements (and
  very few node and way modifications), and if these improvements have been
  corrected by other users since. It is the sign of an specialization to
  complex structures. This component also refers to contributions from foreign
  users (/i.e./ not from the area of interest, here the Bordeaux area),
  familiar with /JOSM/.
+ PC2 (14.5% of total variance) characterizes how experienced and versatile are
  users: this component will be high for users with a high number of activity
  days, a lot of local as well as total change sets, and high numbers of node,
  way and relation modifications. This second component highlights /JOSM/ too.
+ PC3 (9.1% of total variance) describes way-focused contributions by old users
  (but not really productive since their inscription). A high value is
  synonymous of corrected contributions, however that's quite mechanical: if
  you contributed a long time ago, your modifications would probably not be
  up-to-date any more. This component highlights /Potlatch/ and /JOSM/ as the
  most used editors.
+ PC4 (8.7% of total variance) looks like PC3, in the sense that it is strongly
  correlated with way modifications. However it will concern newer users: a
  more recent inscription date, contributions that are less corrected, and more
  often up-to-date. As the preferred editor, this component is associated with
  /iD/.
+ PC5 (6.9% of total variance) refers to a node specialization, from very
  productive users. The associated modifications are overall improvements that
  are still up-to-date. However, PC5 is linked with users that are not at ease
  in our area of interest, even if they produced a lot of change sets
  elsewhere. /JOSM/ is clearly the corresponding editor.
+ PC6 (4.8% of total variance) is strongly impacted by node improvements, by
  opposition to node creations (a similar behavior tends to emerge for
  ways). This less important component highlights local specialists: a fairly
  high quantity of local change sets, but a small total change set
  quantity. Like for PC4, the editor used for such contributions is /iD/.

** Describe individuals positioning after dimensionality reduction

As a recall, we can print the previous user characteristics:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
pca_ind.query("uid==24664").T
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: uid     24664
: PC1 -0.358475
: PC2  1.671158
: PC3  0.121610
: PC4 -0.139444
: PC5 -0.983182
: PC6  0.409357

From the previous lightings, we can conclude that this user is really
experienced (high value of PC2), even if this experience tends to be local
(high negative value for PC5). The fairly good value for PC6 enforces the
hypothesis credibility.

From the different component values, we can imagine that the user is versatile;
there is no strong trend to characterize its specialty. The node creation
activity seems high, even if the last component shades a bit the
conclusion.

Regarding the editors this contributor used, the answer is quite hard to
provide only by considering the six components! /JOSM/ is favored by PC2, but
handicaped by PC1 and PC5; that is the contrary with /iD/; Potlatch is the best
candidate as it is favored by PC3, PC4 and PC5.

By the way, this interpretation exercise may look quite abstract, but just
consider the description at the beginning of the post, and compare it with this
interpretation... It is not so bad, isn't it?

* Cluster the user starting from their past activity

At this point, we have a set of active users (those who have contributed to the
focused area). We propose now to classify each of them without any knowledge on
their identity or experience with geospatial data or OSM API, by the way of
unsupervised learning. Indeed we will design clusters with the k-means
algorithm, and the only input we have are the synthetic dimensions given by the
previous PCA. These dimensions contain information about the past contributions
of each user.

Recall that we are investigating on OSM data quality, it is quite hard to have
an absolute answer, especially without any trustworthy "ground truth". Here we
hypothesize that typical groups of users (*e.g.* beginners, intermediate,
advanced, experts...) will arise from the classification algorithm.

** k-means design: how many cluster may we expect from the OSM metadata?

Like for the PCA, the k-means algorithm is characterized by a parameter that we
must tune, /i.e./ the cluster number.

How many clusters can be identified? We only have access to soft
recommendations given by state-of-the-art procedures. As an illustration here,
we use elbow method, and clustering silhouette.

The former represents the intra-cluster variance, /i.e./ the sparsity of
observations within clusters. It obviously decreases when the cluster number
increases. To keep the model simple and do not overfit it, this quantity has to
be as small as possible. That's why we evoke an "elbow": we are looking for a
bending point designing a drop of the explained variance marginal gain. The
latter is a synthetic metric that indicates how well each individuals is
represented by its cluster. It is comprised between 0 (bad clustering
representation) and 1 (perfect clustering).

The first criterion suggests to take either 2 or 6 clusters, whilst the second
criterion is larger with 6 or 7 clusters. We then decide to take on 6 clusters.

** k-means running: OSM contributor classification

We hypothesize that several kinds of users will be highlighted by the
clustering process. How to interpret the six chosen clusters starting from the
Bordeaux area dataset?

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both
model = KMeans(n_clusters=6, n_init=100, max_iter=1000)
kmeans_ind = pca_ind.copy()
kmeans_ind['Xclust'] = model.fit_predict(pca_ind.values)
kmeans_centroids = pd.DataFrame(model.cluster_centers_,
                                columns=pca_ind.columns)
kmeans_centroids['n_individuals'] = (kmeans_ind
                                     .groupby('Xclust')

The k-means algorithm makes six relatively well-balanced groups (the group 4 is
larger than the others, however the difference is not so high):

+ Group 0 (15.3% of users): high positive PC2 value, other components are
  closed to 0; this group represents most experienced and versatile users. The
  users are seen as OSM key contributors.
+ Group 1 (13.2% of users): medium negative PC1 value, small positive PC3
  value, small negative PC4 and PC5 values; this cluster refers to old one-shot
  contributors, mainly interested in way modifications.
+ Group 2 (17.0% of users): medium negative PC1 value, small negative PC3
  value, small positive PC4 value; this category of user is very close to the
  previous one, the difference being the more recent period during which they
  have contributed.
+ Group 3 (11.0% of users): medium positive PC3 and PC4 values, small negative
  PC1 and PC2 values; this user cluster contains contributors that are locally
  unexperienced, they have proposed mainly way modifications.
+ Group 4 (28.2% of users): high positive PC1 value, other components are
  closed to 0; this cluster refers to relation specialists, users that are
  fairly productive on OSM.
+ Group 5 (15.3% of users): medium negative PC1, PC2 and PC4 values, small
  negative PC3 value, small positive PC5 and PC6 values; this last cluster
  gathers very unexperienced users, that comes just a few times on OSM to
  modify mostly nodes.

To complete this overview, we can plot individuals according to their group,
with respect to the most important components:

#+BEGIN_SRC ipython :session osm :exports both :file ../figs/bordeaux-metropole-kmeans-plot.png
    SUBPLOT_LAYERS = pd.DataFrame({'x':[0,2,4],
                                   'y':[1,3,5]})
    f, ax = plt.subplots(1, 3, figsize=(12,4))
    for i in range(3):
        ax_ = ax[i]
        comp = SUBPLOT_LAYERS.iloc[i][['x', 'y']]
        x_column = 'PC'+str(1+comp[0])
        y_column = 'PC'+str(1+comp[1])
        for name, group in kmeans_ind.groupby('Xclust'):
            ax_.plot(group[x_column], group[y_column], marker='.',
                     linestyle='', ms=10, label=name)
            if i == 0:
                ax_.legend(loc=0)
        ax_.plot(kmeans_centroids[[x_column]],
                 kmeans_centroids[[y_column]],
                 'kD', markersize=10)
        for i, point in kmeans_centroids.iterrows():
            ax_.text(point[x_column]-0.2, point[y_column]-0.2,
                     ('C'+str(i)+' (n='
                      +str(int(point['n_individuals']))+')'),
                      weight='bold', fontsize=14)
        ax_.set_xlabel(x_column + ' ({:.2f}%)'.format(varexp[comp[0]]))
        ax_.set_ylabel(y_column + ' ({:.2f}%)'.format(varexp[comp[1]]))
    plt.tight_layout()

It appears that the first two components allow to discriminate clearly C0 and
C4. We need the third and the fourth components to differentiate C1 and C2 on
the first hand, and C3 and C5 on the other hand. The last two components do not
provide any additional information.

* Conclusion

"Voilà"! We have proposed here a user classification, without any preliminar
knowledge about who they are, and which skills they have. That's an
illustration of the power of unsupervised learning; we will try to apply this
clustering in OSM data quality assessment in a next blog post!
